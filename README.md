# foursquareTest
A quick app made for testing purposes.  Utilizes the foursquare API

Welcome to my test App!

To use the app just run it in your simulator.  When it loads, you can either enter a location manually or hit the location button in the upper right hand corner.  The rest should be self-explanatory.
